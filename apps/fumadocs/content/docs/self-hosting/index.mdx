# Self-Hosting

Deploy the Rediredge data plane (Go redirector + Redis) on your own infrastructure.

## Architecture

The data plane consists of:

- **Go redirector** - Handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic, TLS via autocert, serves 307/308 redirects
- **Redis** - Read model for fast redirect lookups

The control plane (Next.js dashboard) runs separately and syncs data to your Redis instance.

## Requirements

- **Ports:** 80 (HTTP/ACME), 443 (HTTPS), 6379 (Redis)
- **Storage:** Persistent volumes for TLS certificates and Redis data
- **DNS:** A records pointing to your server for each domain
- **Redis:** Password authentication enabled

## Certificate Management

TLS certificates are automatically issued via Let's Encrypt (ACME HTTP-01):

- Certificates stored in `/certs` volume (persistent)
- Auto-renewal before expiration
- Domain validated against Redis before issuance
- Rate limits: 50 certs/domain/week (shared)

**IMPORTANT:** Don't lose the `/certs` volume or you'll hit rate limits.
